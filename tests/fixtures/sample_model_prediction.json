        "content": "Grade: B\n\nThe code is generally well-structured and follows PEP8 style guidelines. The author has included ample unit tests, which makes it clear what each part of the code is supposed to do. However, there are places where the code can be improved.\n\n- In `get_source_filenames`, using os.walk() may be more efficient and easier to read.\n- Instead of having two almost identical statements on lines 64 and 66 for filtering files based on the suffix, you could check the value of the filter_files_by_suffix variable and pass that to the glob.glob function.\n- A comment explaining why the code needs to be split up into tokens might be helpful in `get_prompt`.\n- In `get_prompt`, the for-loop condition on line 74 could be separated into two separate lines to improve readability.\n- Lines 83-87 could be combined into one line to make the code more concise.\n- In `get_args`, using argparse's `choices` argument here (like on line 60) could help enforce good input.\n- Using magic numbers like `MAX_PROMPT_LENGTH` and `GPT_3_5_MAX_TOKENS` should be avoided.\n\nTo further improve the code readability, the author can consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each function in more detail.",
